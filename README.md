Software Engineer who spends too much time messing with AI/ML, infinitely tweaking [dotfiles](https://github.com/IllyaStarikov/.dotfiles) (btw I use Vim), and occasionally solving real-world problems with software. In my free time I enjoy [reading](https://starikov.co/books/), video games, tea, and hanging out with my fiance and cats.

- I [write about](https://starikov.co/) computers, science, and life.
- I started [using computers at age 4](https://starikov.co/about/), playing Doom and Quake.
- I [type over 110 WPM](https://starikov.co/home-row/).
- I worked on a [satellite](https://starikov.co/mr-mrs-sat/) to be launched into space.
